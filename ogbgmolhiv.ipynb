    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a model to predict if a molecule inhibits HIV replication using the [ogbg-molhiv](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/graphprop/#ogbg-mol) dataset.  This is derived from the [MoleculeNet](https://moleculenet.org/) dataset and represents each molecule as a graph, where the nodes are atoms and the edges are chemical bonds.  We will treat this as a graph classification task and use a modified version of the [Graph Isomorphism Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826) (GIN). Once we create this benchmark, we will add the idea of a [Virtual Node](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212). \n",
    "\n",
    "## What you need to do\n",
    "### Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task we're going to apply a GNN to the molecular structure to get node embeddings for each atom and then apply a \"Readout\" function to combine those node embeddings into a representation of the graph.  Instead of having batches of nodes like previous exercises, this time we'll be dealing with batches of small graphs.  This difference will result in some additional implementation complexity.  Sections you need to write code for will be marked with a \"TODO\" comment. For ease of troubleshooting, do not modify any of the code except where indicated until after the basics have been achieved.  We will also import functionality from the `utils.py` script.  No changes should be necessary to this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a correct implementation and can match leaderboard performance, we can move on to experimentation. In this section, we will implement \"Virtual Nodes\", which are nodes added to each graph that connect to all other nodes and therefore provide a short communication path between all nodes in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "In each section, the `repeat_experiments` function is used to run the same model building process multiple times to collect statistics since there is significant variation in performance from run-to-run.  This allows us to make apples-to-apples comparisons to the leaderboard, but this process takes a long time.  Feel free to reduce from the default setup of 10 experiments with 100 epochs each to something much smaller (e.g., 1 experiment with 5 epochs) until you're confident in the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "A great way to learn is to 1) read other peoples' code and 2) tinker. If you want to maximize your learning, the Extra Credit section will provide a few directions for further exploration. As part of this, it's recommended you find another submission on the OGB Leaderboard and try to re-create its submission. This will likely involve reading the paper and code, which is great practice. If you do something interesting and novel, we'll kindly host it in a public repo as an example of your glory (if you wish).\n",

    "For efficiency reasons, the graphs in a minibatch are combined into one \"super-graph\" in which each component graph is disconnected from the others.  This enables us to do message passing across all the graphs in the minibatch simultaneously, but comes with the added complexity of needing to keep track of which nodes belong to which graph.  DGL has built-in tools for dealing with this complexity and we'll make use of them throughout this exercise.  Please review the dataloader code in the following cells if you want to see how this works.  Just keep in mind two things: 1) the graph we're passing into the models is the \"super-graph\" which has all the component graphs in the minibatch combined into one data structure and 2) we'll have to unwind this process when converting from node-level to graph-level representations.\n",

These classes essentially create an embedding lookup table *for each column* in the feature tensor, and then the integer value in a column serves as the row index in the lookup.  The size of each category embedding is specified with the `emb_dim` variable and therefore the number of learnable embedding parameters for a column in the feature tensor is `N_unique * emb_dim`, where $N_{unique}$ is the number of unique categories in the column.  \n",

For example, if there are three categorical feature columns and we specify `emb_dim=5`, each feature will receive a 5-dim embedding, and then those three vectors will be summed to give a single 5-dim vector as a final representation.  This method is used for both the atom node features and the bond edge features.  "

    "In graph classification we typically use GNNs to calculate node embeddings and then combine those node embeddings in some way to get a representation of the graph.  This can be tricky when dealing with batches of graphs for training because we need to keep track of which nodes/edges belongs to which graph.  We therefore break our model into 3 main components: 1) the base convolution layer that implements the GIN update equation, 2) the node-level GNN that stacks GIN layers together to create node embeddings and 3) a graph-level GNN that combines node embeddings to create a graph embedding. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Isomorphic Network layer\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will implement the GIN convolution layer.  The GIN model comes from the [How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826) paper.  The equation to update the embedding $\\mathbf{h}_i$ for node $i$ is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{h}_i^{(l+1)} = \\text{MLP}[ (1 + \\epsilon) \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)} + \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\mathbf{h}_j^{(l)} ]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is some learnable constant and $\\mathcal{N}_i$ indicates the 1-hop neighborhood of node $i$.  Effectively, it's the sum of the current embedding (adjusted by some scaling factor) added to the embeddings of all its neighbors, passed through an MLP.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to slightly modify this architecture to make use of the edge features, however.  We will use the method implemented on the Leaderboard ([code](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/blob/master/examples/graphproppred/mol/conv.py#L31)), which tweaks the message function to add the edge features to the neighbor node embedding, and pass that sum through a ReLU activation.  In the original equation, the message function merely copies the neighbor embedding: $\\mathbf{m}_{ij} = \\mathbf{h}_j$.  Here, the message function will be modified to be: $\\mathbf{m}_{ij} = \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{h}_j + \\mathbf{e}_{ij})$.  The final update equation will therefore become:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{h}_i^{(l+1)} = \\text{MLP}[ (1 + \\epsilon) \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_i^{(l)} + \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{h}_j^{(l)} + \\mathbf{e}_{ij}) ]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This causes a slight implementation complication.  The easiest way to use DGL's message passing API is to pass in standard message and reduce functions to the `update_all` method.  For example, the message passing part of the original GIN equation ($\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\mathbf{h}_j $) would be implemented like:  `g.update_all(fn.copy_u('x', 'm'), fn.sum('m', h')`.  Using these built-in message/reduce functions allow optimizations under the hood that improve memory consumption and computation speed.  However, there is no built-in functions that matches our modified message/reduce function $\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\text{ReLU}(\\mathbf{h}_j + \\mathbf{e}_{ij})$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll get around this by breaking up the computation into two steps.  Specifically, we can call `apply_edges` to create the messages (which become a new tensor defined on `g.edata`), but not yet aggregate them.  For example, calling `g.apply_edges(fn.copy_u('x', 'm'))` would copy the value of the `x` tensor for each node and assign it to each edge where that node is the source, and the result would be accessible via `g.edata['m']`.  In other words, this broadcasts node data to the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then modify that new edge tensor as an intermediate processing step (e.g., by calling `F.relu` on it), and finally call `update_all` using the `fn.copy_e` message function to use this new, modified message.  If we were implementing the original GIN equation with this two-step process without any modification, it would look something like the following:\n",

    "Finally, we will create a graph-level GNN that uses the node-level GNN as a component, combines the node embeddings of each graph to create a graph-level embedding, and uses this with a Linear layer to generate a prediction for each graph.  The function for converting a set of node embeddings into a graph embedding is sometimes called a \"Readout\" function.  Our readout function will simply be the average of all the node embeddings in the graph:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{h}_\\mathcal{G} = \\frac{1}{|V_\\mathcal{G}|}\\sum_{j \\in V_\\mathcal{G}} \\mathbf{h}_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then make a class prediction for each graph by passing this graph-level embedding through a standard Linear layer:  $\\hat y = \\sigma ( \\mathbf{W} \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_\\mathcal{G} + \\mathbf{b} )$\n",
    "\n",
    "The only real challenge here is related to how we've combined our minibatch of graphs into the \"super-graph\", which results in our node-level GNN returning a tensor of shape `(N_nodes, emb_dim)`, where `N_nodes` count the nodes from *all the graphs in the batch*.  To get the graph-level representation, we'll have to average together the correct rows from that tensor so that only the nodes from the same component graphs are aggregated together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, DGL makes this easy with its [read-out ops](https://docs.dgl.ai/api/python/dgl.html#batching-and-reading-out-ops) (e.g., `dgl.mean_nodes`).  The output of this readout function will be of size `(N_graphs, emb_dim)`, where `N_graphs` are the number of graphs in the minibatch that were combined into the \"super-graph\".  Once we have this, we can pass it through the linear layer to generate a final prediction.  Your task is to implement the `forward` pass of this model."

    "# Improvements with Virtual Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "One architecture change that's common to see on the leaderboard for graph classification tasks are the inclusion of \"virtual nodes\", which seem to be first described in the [Neural message passing for quantum chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212) paper.  For a given graph in the batch, the idea is to add a new node that shares a connection with all other nodes.  This creates an information pathway during message passing for node pairs that might be large distances from one another in the original graph.  If long-range information is important, which is likely to be the case with molecules modeled as graphs, then this may provide an alternative to e.g., building deep GNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to implement virtual nodes might be to modify each graph to add a new node that's fully connected, which would allow us to leverage built-in message passing functionality.  This is complicated, however, because these virtual nodes/edges do not have features like the normal nodes and edges in the graphs.  We choose here to not modify the topology of the underlying graphs and instead implement the message passing operations manually.  This will consist of two separate steps: 1) add the messages from the virtual nodes to each node in the graphs and 2) update the virtual nodes by adding in messages from all the other nodes in the graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Messages *from* the virtual nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding messages from the virtual nodes is made more complicated because we need to keep the computations separate for each component graph in the \"super-graph\".  We don't want to send messages from one graph in the batch to another, for example.  One other nuance is that we'll use a _shared virtual node embedding_ that represents the input features of the virtual node and is the same for all graphs in the dataset.  We will duplicate these virtual node parameters so every graph in the batch has its own copy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we send messages to the nodes we will need to convert from a graph-level tensor, where each row corresponds to a graph in the minibatch, to a nodel-level one.  To do this we will duplicate each graph's copy of the virtual node embedding for each of its nodes.  As an example, if we have two graphs in the batch which have 3 and 4 nodes, respectively, we'll first get: `h_virt_graph = [h_virt_g1, h_virt_g2]`, which creates two copies of the embedding for each graph in the batch.  We then transform that into a node-level representation like: `h_virt_node = [h_virt_g1, h_virt_g1, h_virt_g1, h_virt_g2, h_virt_g2, h_virt_g2, h_virt_g2]`, where each graph's copy is duplicated for every node it contains.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we do this is it allows us to easily add the message from the correct virtual node to each of the nodes in the \"super-graph\".  Consider the following.  Let's say we have calculated the \"normal\" message passing result, where we have ignored the idea of virtual nodes:  `h_mp_normal = g.update_all(fn.copy('x', 'm'), fn.sum('m', 'h'))`.  This result would have a row for every node where the value represents the sum of all the messages in that node's neighborhood.  We can then simply add the message of the virtual node corresponding to the correct graph by: `h_mp_total = h_mp_normal + h_virt_node`, since `h_virt_node` has already taken care of duplicating the correct graph-level copy of the virtual node.  This will give the same result as if each graph had a copy of the virtual node in its graph structure during message passing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Messages *to* the virtual nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "To update the representations of the virtual nodes throughout the GNN layers we also need to send messages from the nodes in the graphs back to the virtual nodes.  This is the reason each graph needs its own copy of the virtual node embedding, as each update to a virtual node should only contain messages from a single component graph.  We will implement this by operating on `h_virt_graph`, which has the graph-level copies of the virtual node embedding.  We will update these embeddings for a given GNN layer by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Summing the current representations of all the nodes in a component graph\n",
    "2. Adding that result to the graph's virtual node embedding\n",
    "3. Passing that result through an MLP that's shared across all virtual nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 1-2 represent the message passing operation for the virtual nodes.  The only challenge here is in collapsing the tensor of node representations back into graph-level ones, since we only want to sum the node embeddings coming from the same component graph.  We can use DGL's built-in [read-out](https://docs.dgl.ai/api/python/dgl.html#batching-and-reading-out-ops) functions for managing this complexity (e.g., `dgl.sum_nodes`)."
